# Status

Active plan: PLAN-1
PLAN-2: LOCKED
PLAN-1 gate: IN PROGRESS

## Plan sequence

```text
PLAN-1   (executable now)      -> PLAN-1 GATE READY   -> humans complete PLAN-1-REVIEW.md
PLAN-1.5 (locked until then)   -> PLAN-1.5 GATE READY -> stop; PLAN-2 is not written yet
```

PLAN-1.5 supersedes two things PLAN-1 already shipped, by design (PLAN-1.5 §13):
P1-0107's organisation-wide presence fan-out becomes accepted-People-scoped, and
P1-0108's directory-backed People grid becomes connection-backed. P15-0113 also
replaces P1-0603's end-to-end flow. Remaining PLAN-1 work therefore does not
deepen the organisation-wide presence assumption, and P1-0603 stays minimal
because it is rewritten in PLAN-1.5.

`python3 scripts/ralph.py` reports which plan is live and what is next.

## Current state

- next task: P1-0512
- completed: 58 of 68 (phases A, B and C complete; D in progress)
- blocked: 1 (P1-0312 - needs two real machines; see Blocked below)
- one command proves the lot: `make verify` (check + smoke + e2e + boundary + WebRTC)

## Last run

- task: P1-0511 keyboard focus lease
- result: done
- tests: `npm test` 317 passed (284 desktop + 33 protocol), `make check` green
- evidence:
  - typing takes the keyboard and every keystroke renews it. Two people typing into one
    editor is not collaboration, it is a mess, so a competing participant is refused as `busy`
    and the first typist keeps it
  - the lease is **not** handed back on key-up, unlike a drag: typing is a run of presses with
    gaps, and losing the keyboard between two keystrokes would let somebody else type into the
    middle of a word. It ends on inactivity, disconnect or revoke instead
  - held keys are released in **reverse press order**, so a modifier held over another key
    comes up last and no intermediate release lands as a bare keystroke
  - a revoke mid-word lets go of Shift immediately rather than waiting for the sender to be
    polite about it; the sender's own key-up afterwards is still accepted
  - releasing is asynchronous because it talks to the helper, so the work is chained and
    `settle()` lets a caller wait for it - nothing else guarantees a key is up before the next
    person takes the lease
  - the pointer and the keyboard lease independently: somebody typing does not stop somebody
    else clicking
  - key codes are held in memory only and never logged, including in the failure path

## Blocked

```text
BLOCKED: P1-0312
Reason:
  Acceptance requires first real-machine benchmark results on three paths (LAN,
  ordinary NAT, forced TURN). Containerisation closed part of this: the relay
  path is now genuinely verified against a real coturn on one machine. What is
  still impossible here is a second endpoint - LAN and ordinary-NAT numbers, and
  any latency figure that means anything, need two physical machines.
Evidence:
  - the harness and schema exist and run: `make bench` writes
    benchmarks/results/<scenario>/<timestamp>.json with percentiles, budgets and
    environment metadata
  - the media path is proven working, single-machine: `make test-webrtc` reports
    a real decoded 320x240 screen share, route "direct", RTT 1ms
  - the forced-relay switch is proven both ways, single-machine: relay-only
    gathers zero host candidates and does not connect without TURN, and
    `make test-turn` connects *through* a containerised coturn with
    `route: "relay"`, `relayed: true`, relay candidates at both ends
  - the procedure for the three paths is written down in test/network/README.md
Smallest human decision needed:
  Who runs the two-machine benchmark pass, and on which pair of machines?
Options:
  a) A human runs `make bench` plus the test/network/README.md procedure on two
     real machines (LAN, then ordinary NAT; the TURN path is already covered by
     `make test-turn`) and commits the result files. P1-0312 then closes on real
     evidence.
  b) Narrow P1-0312's acceptance to single-machine baselines now and re-open the
     real-machine numbers as part of the P1-0604 soak, which needs two machines
     anyway.
  c) Defer both to the PLAN-1 gate and accept that Phase D closes without
     network evidence - not recommended: SPEC §16 budgets would go unverified.
```

## Known issues / decisions needed

- Deviation from the seed's suggested `allowed_paths`: npm workspaces are used instead of pnpm
  (pnpm is not installed on the build host and no global installs were made). This adds
  `package-lock.json` instead of `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Redaction key lists are duplicated in Go and TypeScript (no shared artefact is allowed by
  P1-0005's `allowed_paths`); each side has its own test, so drift is visible but not blocked.
- **Owed by humans, not producible here:** the multi-machine evidence in P1-0312 (LAN,
  ordinary NAT, forced TURN between two real machines) and the one-hour pairing soak in
  P1-0604. The harnesses will be built and run single-machine; the real-machine numbers must
  be collected before the PLAN-1 gate.
- The Windows helper is only cross-*compiled* here (`GOOS=windows go build ./...`), because no
  Windows machine is available and the Makefile is outside P1-0505's `allowed_paths`. Wiring
  that cross-build into `make ci` needs a task whose paths include the Makefile.
- **Owed by humans, not producible here:** a real Windows run of the pointer and keyboard
  paths, including one click aimed at an elevated window to confirm the integrity-boundary
  message is the one a person actually sees.
- PLAN-2 is not written until the human gate.
